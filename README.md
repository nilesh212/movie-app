<h1>Movie App</h1>

The Movie App is a React-based web application designed to manage a dynamic list of movies. The app comes with a preloaded set of movie names, allowing users to expand the list by searching for additional titles through a search bar and adding them to the collection. The app also supports marking movies as favorites, providing a user-friendly interface for managing personal movie preferences.

This project was developed with a focus on mastering state management in React, particularly through the use of Context API and Redux.
